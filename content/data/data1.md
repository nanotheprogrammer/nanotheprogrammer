## And thus it began

I was once gently rowing through a small lake somewhere in Sporades, when the warm sunshine of that merry spring made me ponder on a question: Why humans collectively never noticed a certain pattern in the fact that a ‘rising’ sun can never be seen making any movement patently perpendicular to either of the two horizons (i. e. the horizon of its rise and that of its set)? This then made me look at the water around me and ask further, why it took so long to get to that Eureka moment, as one finally bothered to seek an explanation for the phenomena that some objects sink, while others do not. Why could only some of us humans perceive the motion of that heavenly body and the nature of water in this manner? Why did this “striking of a special pattern” never happened in the minds of the many, but only in those of the few? It was a certain preoccupation with questions as these that lurks me into our past.

## That stroke of chance

I come from a family of building contractors, hoteliers and bankers. Accordingly, a high regard for applicable knowledge preformed the intellectual atmosphere in our home, although notions like ‘L’ art pour l’art’ or ‘Vidya vidye sathi’ (engl. Knowledge for the sake of knowledge) were never disregarded. Originally fated to inherit and manage our hotel and to acquire knowledge in the field of commerce for that end, some fundamental questions pertaining to the history of mathematics (and later that of other sciences) kindled my interest for a more professional way for investigating this niche of our human past.

In consistence with such interests, my journey in the world of formal education has been this:

2015: Conclusion of secondary education (Class XII) in Economics, Finance and Foreign & Ancient Languages (German, French, Sanskrit and Ancient Greek)

2018: Bachelors Degree in Economics, Commerce and Computer Science

2024: Second Bachelors Degree (a) in History and Philosophy of Sciences; (b) in German Studies (University of Frankfurt)

Aspiration for the time till 2027: Masters in History of Natural Sciences and Mathematics (at Université Paris Cité, Paris)
