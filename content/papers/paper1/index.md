##### Abstract

Where to mark a boundary between philosophy and the exact science? Where in fact between science and theology? Were these in the 'age of science' always and consistently kept apart from each other? The paper endeavours to investigate these questions by testing Thomsons vortex theory and Niels Bohrs theory of atoms in regard to their "scientific rigour" (germ. 'Wissenschaftlichkeit').
